## Why?
The Tyk Dashboard by default, includes nice functionality for a developer portal but in some cases, custom logic is required or to embed a portal into an existing platform. Thankfully Tyk is flexible enough to provide an easy way of integrating the portal to any platform and language using a few API calls.
